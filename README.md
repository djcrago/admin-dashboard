This project was an exercise in using CSS Grid. This was my longest project so
far. In the course of coding this project I learned...

* How to create a CSS grid
* That most grids need more tracks than I originally thought to achieve the
desired affect
* How to use a combination of px and vw/vh to achieve a desired look
* Using svg icons and adapting to having black icons
* Some sections of a website would really benefit from using grid, such as the
cards section, other parts would really benefit from flex, such as the sidebar
